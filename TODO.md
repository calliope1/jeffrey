### TO-DO list for the Choiceless Grapher

# Fix parse.lisp (finish upgrading to maxpc)

\\smallskip is not a good eq-form separator, it appears inside LaTeX-statements of forms (e.g. "14 CY"). Switch to "\\smallskip
\\item{}{\\bf [".

Also finish checking read.lisp.

# Add short names?

This could be very non-straightforward, as there is no obvious way to do this well.

# Improve predicate algorithms

Implement one of the nice path finding graph algorithms of the AlgorithmsI course (coursera).
