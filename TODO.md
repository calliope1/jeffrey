### TO-DO list for the Choiceless Grapher

# Figure out pdf output issue

PDF output does not render fancy labels properly. Why?
For the moment use png, which is the current default. 

# Add short names?

This could be very non-straightforward, as there is no obvious way to do this well.

# Improve predicate algorithms

Implement one of the nice path finding graph algorithms of the AlgorithmsI course (coursera).

# Add Windows and Macintosh support.

The external-programs only work for Linux for the moment.

# Create proper website

and set up Choiceless Grapher to be used via a web form.
