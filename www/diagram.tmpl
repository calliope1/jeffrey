<p> An arrow from A to B means that A implies B. <br/>
A boldfaced arrow from A to B moreover means that B does not imply A in ZF, so the arrow is provably not reversible in ZF. </p>

<p>If the image is too small, right click and select 'Show image' (or similar), or resize your browser window.</p>

<p> For the moment, please look up the references to these implications at the <a href="http://bookstore.ams.org/surv-59"><strong>Consequences of the Axiom of Choice Project book</strong></a>.</p>
